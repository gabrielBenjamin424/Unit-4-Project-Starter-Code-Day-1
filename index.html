        <h2 class="words">Quotes</h2>
        	<p class="words">“I had this beautiful little domain, it was all mine. I was the emperor, the captain of it, and it was quite commodious. I had warm coffee, even.”</p>
        	<p class="words">“I really believe that if the political leaders of the world could see their planet from a distance of, let’s say 100,000 miles, their outlook would be fundamentally changed. The all-important border would be invisible, that noisy argument suddenly silenced.”</p>
